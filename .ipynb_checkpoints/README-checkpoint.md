# Fast Calder√≥n Preconditioning for the Electric Field Integral Equation

## Comparison of preconditioners in a Bi-Parametric Framework

We test several preconditioning techniques based on open source Python library BEMPP. 
You can use Bempp Docker image following these [instructions](https://bempp.com/download/docker/).
A tutorial of Bi-Parametric-based preconditioning for the EFIE is presented in Comparison.ipynb.

Tested with Bempp 3.3.2 - Python 3.5.2 - Numpy 1.11.0
